# NLP_Text_Classification_With_ML
Natural Language Procession For Text Classification and Machine learning 

# Text Classification is one model of supervised machine learning task with a labelled dataset containing text documents and their labels is used for train a classifier.

# Steps : -

# 1. Dataset Preparation: 

Dataset Preparation step which includes the process of loading a dataset and performing basic pre-processing. The dataset is then splitted into train and validation sets.


# 2. Feature Engineering: 

Feature Engineering in which the raw dataset is transformed into flat features which can be used in a machine learning model. This step also includes the process of creating new features from the existing data.


# 3. Model Training: 

Model Building step in which a machine learning model is trained on a labelled dataset.


# 4. Improve Performance of Text Classifier: 

we will use different ways to improve the performance of text classifiers.
