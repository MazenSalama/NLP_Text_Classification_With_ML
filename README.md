# NLP_Text_Classification_With_ML
Natural Language Procession For Text Classification and Machine learning 

Text Classification is one model of supervised machine learning task with a labelled dataset containing text documents and their labels is used for train a classifier.

# Steps : -

# 1. Dataset Preparation: 

Dataset Preparation step which includes the process of loading a dataset and performing basic pre-processing. The dataset is then splitted into train and validation sets.


# 2. Feature Engineering: 

Feature Engineering in which the raw dataset is transformed into flat features which can be used in a machine learning model. This step also includes the process of creating new features from the existing data.

# 2. Feature Engineering

In this step, raw text data will be transformed into feature vectors #and new features will be created using the existing dataset. We will implement the following different ideas in #order to obtain relevant features from our dataset.

2.1 Count Vectors as features

2.2 TF-IDF Vectors as features

-Word level

-N-Gram level

-Character level

2.3 Word Embeddings as features

2.4 Text / NLP based features

2.5 Topic Models as features



# 3. Model Building & Training: 

Model Building step in which a machine learning model is trained on a labelled dataset.


-Naive Bayes Classifier

-Linear Classifier

-Support Vector Machine

-Bagging Models
